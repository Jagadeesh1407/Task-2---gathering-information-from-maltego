Hii All of you, As i worked as a intern in Technohacks, I came across a project task is "Gathering information from maltego" in kali linux. 
Here we discuss that how we install maltego in windows, kali and mac and study the maltego and how can we gather information in maltego.


Here we discuss how to install maltego there are two ways to install the maltego from the internet and we can also install from the command prompt shell.
1. We can easily download the maltego exe file. First go to the website https://www.maltego.com/downloads/ and in that download according to the softwares you are used.

In the new opening graph we had been seen that all the entity pallete are available in the left side and in the top toggle we have all the control settings that has in the middle that is the canvas graph and in the right section that contains all the machines available for that entity.
